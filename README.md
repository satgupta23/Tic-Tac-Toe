# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Python)

A **classic 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game** built entirely in **Python** for the command line.  
This project demonstrates **algorithmic thinking, control flow, input validation, and game logic** implementation from scratch, without using any game engines or external frameworks.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game played on a **3x3 board**, where two players take turns marking the spaces with **X** and **O**.

This Python program:

- Prints a **real-time board** after each move.
- **Validates player inputs** to prevent invalid or repeated moves.
- **Detects winners or draw** automatically.
- **Offers replay functionality** for multiple consecutive matches.
